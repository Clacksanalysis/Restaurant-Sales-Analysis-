## ✅ Recommendations Based on Findings

1. **Promote High-Performing Cuisines**  
   Chinese and American cuisines generate the highest sales. Consider prioritizing these in marketing campaigns or upsell strategies.

2. **Improve Customer Satisfaction**  
   The average customer satisfaction rating is just **3.01** out of 5. Conduct deeper analysis (e.g., surveys, feedback forms) to understand and address pain points.

3. **Balance Payment Options**  
   Payment methods are almost evenly split (Cash, Credit Card, PayPal). Ensure all methods remain optimized, and consider offering incentives for lower-fee options to reduce transaction costs.

4. **Explore Causes of Monthly Sales Fluctuations**  
   Sales peak in **April and July**, with a dip in **February**. Investigate external factors (seasonality, promotions, holidays) to either replicate success or boost slow months.

5. **Refine Discount Strategy**  
   Average discount applied is **0.50**, and all cuisine types have similar discount values. Consider targeted discounting based on cuisine performance or customer loyalty rather than applying them uniformly.

6. **Expand High-Performing Patterns**  
   For cuisines with high satisfaction and high sales (e.g., Chinese), replicate successful menu items, pricing, or service strategies across underperforming cuisines.

7. **Monitor Underperforming Cuisine Types**  
   Mexican and Indian cuisines have lower sales. Assess customer preferences, pricing, or product offerings to improve appeal.

8. **Use Insights for Strategic Planning**  
   Align staffing, supply orders, and promotions with months or cuisine types that generate the most traffic and revenue.
